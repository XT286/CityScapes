# CityScapes_GAN

This Notebook is merely a practice type-in from Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/cityscapes-image-pairs,

where you can find the data source, as well as this notebook:

https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/ingesting-cityscapes-images-in-tensorflow.

This Notebook uses GAN library in tensorflow to re-generate the cityscape pictures from their given semantic segmentation.

Again: this notebook has nothing new until further notice.
